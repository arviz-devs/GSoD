# ArviZ Visual Refresh, Python API Assessment, and other advice
ArviZ is a Python and Julia libary for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models,
and includes many [vizualizations](https://python.arviz.org/en/latest/examples/index.html)
to that end.

As with any open source package part of the challenge is maintaining an existing package.
As part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative funds have been set aside for this express purpose.

The scope of this work is to assess update visual style of the package (all components including docs)
and perform an assessment of the API (primary python), and offer any other advice

* Provide a design guide
  This ideally would be in the form of an MPL, Bokeh, or other style template.
  A README.md style guide should provided if deemed necessary as well.

* Critique of the Python or Julia API 
  This role will require you to get hands on with code. During this hands on process
  document improvements that could be made to the API and code workflow itself
  would be expected.

  In the course of performing this work, detailed issues tickets or reccomendations
  for challenges or improvements would aid the ArviZ team in elevating the suite of projects
