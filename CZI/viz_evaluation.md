# ArviZ Visual Refresh, Python API Assessment, and other advice
ArviZ is a Python and Julia library for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models,
and includes many [vizualizations](https://python.arviz.org/en/latest/examples/index.html)
to that end.

As with any open source package part of the challenge is maintaining an existing package.
As part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative funds have been set aside for this express purpose.

The scope of this work is to assess update visual style of the package (all components including docs)
and perform an assessment of the API (primary python), and offer any other advice

## Job description
We are expecting a report covering the following points (sorted in descending priority):


1. Provide a design guide

   This ideally would be in the form of a README.md style guide with explanation and references,
   with focus around ArviZ usecases and bad practices we might be using now.
   A matplotlib, Bokeh, or other style template could also be included as complementary material

1. Critique of the Python or Julia API

   This role will require you to get hands on with code.
   During this process documenting the improvements that could be made to the API and
   code workflow itself is expected, updates to the code are not a priority.

1. Analysis of available visualizations across Python and Julia

   Evaluate and criticize current plots for visual style and effectiveness.
   Critique the visual clarity of each

1. Any other advice or tips

   In the course of performing this work, detailed issues tickets or recommendations
   for challenges or improvements would aid the ArviZ team in elevating the suite of projects


## Job requirements
* Not being part of the ArviZ team
* A strong design sense
* Familiarity with open source and ability to navigate ArviZ issues and documentation

## Support from ArviZ devs
We will be available to help answer questions, review pull requests, and help as needed.
We may not be available on short notice, but will do our best to ensure no question goes unanswered

We are also planning on working on a redesign and proof of concept of a refactor
of the plots module of the Python library at some point during July-September 2022.
We'll try to coordinate to take into account the provided API critique or even
to have the API critique be on the proposed refactored API.

## Payment
The budget for this project is $1500 which will be paid through NumFOCUS
