# Creating a statement of interest

Based in the [official GSoD resources](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-statement)

In the 2021 Season of Docs program, organizations work directly with technical writers to create, improve, and update documentation.
Organizations select technical writers directly.

Technical writers interested in working with us should submit a statement of interest by mail to `arviz.devs@gmail.com`.
Statements of interest shared on Gitter, as PRs submitted here or in any other channel will not be considered.

Your statement of interest should include your contact information,
information about your technical writing experience,
and an outline of the work you would do with the organization.

It should also highlight how you meet any specific requirements and skills in our [selection criteria]().
Read the [project scope page]() carefully to make sure you have included all the required information.

This template is an outline to help you create your own statement of interest.

## Personal information

Include your name and email address.
If you do not wish your name included in the public final case study reports,
please note that in your proposal and provide a username.

## Professional information

* A link to a publicly accessible portfolio of writing samples, or individual links to examples of your work.
* An overview of your recent technical writing experience:
   * List your most recent technical writing roles or work experience. Summarize your role, the responsibilities of the role, and the work you completed. Provide dates where relevant.
   * If you have open source documentation experience (in any language, not necessarily Python/Julia), include it here too.
* A link to your resume or curriculum vitae (CV).
* (Optional) Any other information you want to add. For example, your interest in technical documentation, why you want to participate in Season of Docs, or other relevant experience.

## Project statement

   * Pay attention to the language and style of your proposal.
* Proposed timeline and budget
   * Give a general outline of the timeline and phases of the project. For example, you may budget two weeks for information gathering, four weeks for writing, two weeks for review and changes, and a week for publication.
   * Include explicit expectations for participation and feedback from us. What will you need from the mentors? Fast answers to queries, help getting started with sphinx/documenter...
